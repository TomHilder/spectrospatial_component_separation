# spectrospatial_component_separation

Gaussian spectral decomposition with spatial coherence.

## Notes

Currently this is just a few scripts. Installation with `uv` is as simple as cloning and in this directory doing `uv sync`.

You can run the toy model by running the `main.py` script in `scripts/`, which also must be the current working directory while running.
